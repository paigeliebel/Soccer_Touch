############################ Pairing Touches Together ############################

#event-level Interrater Reliability
#Some touches are only seen by one rater
#Some raters will have multiple touches at one time
#Paired Touch = Same time +-2 seconds, Season Match Number, TeamID, Touch Action
#If multiple fall into these buckets, then 'pair' at random. Such that if Rater 1 counts 4 with these criteria
#and Rater 2 has 5 and Rater 3 has 6, then 4 would be paired across 3 raters (1 through 4), 1 across 2 raters (the 5th seen by both Rater 2 and 3), and 1 alone (the last one by Rater 3)


############################ Deeper Dive ############################

#What percent of paired touches are similar?
#As in, within a paired touch, do the raters have the same players, reciprocity, etc?

#This would be for Tobi and Simon
#I feel that what I have already done should be sufficient
