##### Great. So now we know there is an "uptick" in touches throughout the match
##### Touch rate doesn't appear 'constant' throughout a match. I feel like I can't compare 
##### touch rate before a goal to touch rate over a whole match of no scoring
##### look at total match by match analysis? Players who scored, the rate before scoring,
##### and the rate of the overall touch rate for the match for the player --> too many confounding variables
##### if the player scores, the team is winning. Do we look at them compared to players who don't score? 
##### do we look at average touch rate up to the point of their average goal scoring moment? That seems wrong.
