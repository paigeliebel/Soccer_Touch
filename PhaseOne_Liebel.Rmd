## Phase One: Initial Data Analysis and Exploration 

# Questions for Anne to address:

Spoke with Annett: non-parametric vs parametric for each subset of data, phase 2 (ordinal mixed effects model that allows for nesting etc)

*Shapiro-Wilk Test showed parametric and sometimes non-parametric depending on the data set analyzed. For example, total overall touch frequency at the season level was normally distributed across teams, but not when we broke it down to match level. Annett said to run a test for each test and use what is appropriate for each data subset. What do you think? Previously we were set on doing only non-parametric*

Note: One limitation of this dataset is that most variables are not continuous. For example, final rank is ordinal (a team cannot finish 3.5th), and goal differential is an integer. This restricts the use of certain statistical models. We will address this further in Phase Two using an ordinal mixed-effects model framework.

# Document Run-through

1. **Season-Level Data Overview**
Data Filtering Process
Flow Chart
Total Season-Level Touches By Team

2. **Season Outcome Hypothesis**  
_Hypothesis:_ Teams with higher frequencies of pro-social touch across the season would achieve better final standings.  
_Finding:_ No strong association was observed between total pro-social touch frequency over the season and final standings (counter to prior findings in basketball). Further work could explore alternate modeling approaches (e.g., controlling for goal celebrations).
Data Management, merging, and cleaning not shown.

This led to considering a by-match analysis in relation to end-of-seaon outcome. 
-Touches per Game
-Variation of Touch Per Game within each Team
-Scaled per team analysis

3. **Outlier Analysis**

Suggested that we should take a look at how touch levels affect the outcome of individual matches.

4. **Match Outcome Hypothesis**
_Hypothesis:_ Matches where teams exceeded their typical touch behavior would be associated with better match outcomes.  
_Finding:_ A significant positive correlation was observed — matches where teams displayed higher-than-usual prosocial touch behavior were associated with more favorable goal differentials.

-Unscaled
-Scaled

5. **Type of Touch: Reciprocity**
*Does type of touch matter?*
Steps 2-4 above looked at touch frequency. This breaks the analysis down into how players are touching each other.

Similar to steps 2-4, we start with a season level outcome analysis and then go into match by match. 

_Hypothesis 1:_ Teams with a higher ratio of reciprocal vs. non-reciprocal touches finish higher in the standings.  
_Finding:_ A higher reciprocal-to-non-reciprocal touch ratio was not associated with better standings. 

_Hypothesis 1.a:_ Matches where teams have a higher ratio of reciprocal vs. non-reciprocal touches would be associated with better match outcomes.  
_Finding:_ A higher reciprocal-to-non-reciprocal touch ratio at the match-level was associated with more favorable goal differentials. 

Also looked at 'scaled' version of match-level goal differentials. 

6. **Social Network Strength**

Player Touch Concentration and Role Dynamics

_Hypothesis:_ Teams with more evenly distributed touch behaviors across players would finish higher in the end of season standings.  
_Finding:_ Teams with a more evenly shared involvement (lower Gini) tended to finish higher in the standings.

-Touch Concentration: Who Initiate and Recievers Touches (Toucher and Touchee)
-Role Dynamics: Do players act as both touchers and touchees?
-Role Ratio
-Relative Touch Contribution

7. **Time-Elapsed Touch Frequency**

Examines how Run-of-play touch frequency evolves throughout a match.

Pokes at building a possible 'causal framework'.

Compare pre-goal touch rate vs season baseline touch rate.

Asks whether touch behaviors precede scoring (suggesting touch helps create scoring opportunities) or if they are a response to scoring (suggesting celebration or momentum).

_Hypothesis 1:_ Teams that score the first goal of a match exhibit a higher touch count (up to that point) than their average in matches where they did not score first.
_Finding:_ No significant difference; elevated pre-goal touch is not universally predictive.

This led me to realize that there is perhaps a difference in pre-goal touch differences between winners and losers in the match. Maybe pre-goal touch does precede the first goal, but it explains the trajection. 

_Hypothesis 2:_ Teams that score the first goal of a match exhibit a higher touch count (up to that point) than their average in matches where they did not score first.
_Finding:_ No significant difference; elevated pre-goal touch is not universally predictive.



8. **Inter-Rater Reliability**

Reliable across touch frequency, reciprocal, and non-reciprocal.

## Overview Summary and Touch Data Filtering

In this section, we summarize the raw touch dataset and walk through the filtering process that created the dataset used for hypothesis testing. 
This includes defining what counts as a prosocial touch, removing non-gameflow situations like goals and substitutions, and labeling touches as reciprocal or nonreciprocal.

# *1. Season-Level Data Overview*

Data Summary of total touch instances, matches watched, teams included, etc.

Table 1 Below. Summary of dataset dimensions before filtering.

```{r Summary_table_season, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Summary_Table_A
```

### Data Filtering Process

We apply a stepwise filtering procedure:

1. Remove touches not categorized as prosocial (i.e., exclude tactical or negative interactions)
2. Exclude resource and success based situations: goals, substitutions
3. Label remaining touches based on reciprocity: reciprocal vs. nonreciprocal

The flowchart below shows how many data points remain after each step an what data was removed from analysis.

![Data Flowchart](Flow_Chart_image.png)

Table 2 Below. Number of observations remaining at each filtering step as seen in flowchart.

```{r summary_table_flowchart, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
touch_summary_fowchart
```

### Team-Level Season Totals

We then assess touch frequency by team, both for the full dataset and the filtered dataset. This helps identify outliers in overall team behavior and provides input for later scaling steps.

Section Below shows unfiltered, full dataset (of all recorded touches) by team:

```{r unfiltered_total_season_by_team, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

unfiltered

unfiltered_graph

```

Now we take the first branch of the flowchart to the Prosocial Run-of-play touches, excluding the nonsocial touches (Tactical, collisions, negative) along with success/resource based touches such as goals and subs. This is refered to in the code as 'coredata'.

Again, below is a by team break down of Run-of-play (prosocial) touches.

```{r prosocial_total_season_by_team, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
filtered

filtered_plot

totalseason_parametric

# Data is normal. Therefore, parametric.
```

*Shapiro-Wilk Test showed that this data set, the total season touches filtered to the run of play is normally distributed. However, this is just for overall Touch Frequency in the season, once we break it down further, things can change.*

Boxplot comparison of the overall, unfiltered data which includes both prosocial and nonsocial touches to the core data subset used in the rest of analysis which includes only run-of-play. 

```{r tota_season_boxplot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
totalseason_boxplot 
```

We begin by testing a core hypothesis: do teams that touch more throughout the season perform better by the end of the season?

# *2. Season Outcome Hypothesis*

How does season level touch frequency tie to end of season success?

```{r TouchFreq_vs_FinalStandings, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
TouchFreq_vs_FinalStandings
```

Appears that there is not a strong assosciation between run-of-play touch frequency, including its variation within a team, and the team's end of season results.

While no clear association emerged at the season level, we now investigate whether *match-level* touch frequency relates to outcomes like goal differential.

# By-Match Breakdown of Touch Frequency relation to End of Season Outcome

Interested in looking at by-match breakdown in relation to end of season success. Previously looked at overall touch at the season level.
This is still looking at only Prosocial, run-of-play data. 

```{r match_break_down_team, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#First just Histogram of touch frequency per match across all teams
touches_permatch_plot 

#Check normalacy

touches_per_match_parametric

#NON-PARAMETIC! Do not use linear regression etc. use non-parametric alternatives.


```

*By-match level data is non-parametric according to Shapiro-Wilks test*

```{r match_break_down_team2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#By team explosion of histograms

touches_permatch_plot_teamlevel

#Ridgeline Plot
#Stacked Density plot for each team
#height of curve is relative frequency of touch

touch_permatch_ridgelineplot

#Same thing but ordered by final rank
# Visualize with boxplots 
TouchesPerGame_vs_rank

```

Could overall season success be based on a teams consistency of touch?

**No relationship between scaled variability within-a-team and end of season rankings.**

# *3. Outlier Analysis*

Outlier defined as 1.5 IQR

*Could extreme touch level matches be associated with with better outcomes?*

```{r Outliers, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

match_outcomes_outliers

# Display nicely formatted table in R Markdown
kable(outcome_summary_table, caption = "Match Outcomes by Outlier Status")

fisher_res

```

Fisher Test shows that there is a non-random association between the two groups, normal and outlier match outcomes. Accurate for small sample sizes. 

Extreme touch events seem to propose a different match outcome. If a team is way touchier than normal, it appears to be associated at success at the match level. Dive into match level analysis.

# *4. Match Outcome Hypothesis*

Is touch frequency tied to match level success?

Are high touch frequency matches associated with high goal differentials?

Start with unscaled, not adjusted to the team's individual profile:

```{r unscaled_by_match_plots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
Touch_Unscaled_GoalDiff_Plot

Touch_Unscaled_GoalDiff_cor_test 
```

*Spearman test shows significance. Higher touch rates in a match are associated to wins.*

Scaled, as before, to the team's individual profile:

```{r scaled_by_match_plots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

# Visualize 
Touch_GoalDiff_scaled_plot

# Spearman:
Touch_Scaled_GoalDiff_cor_test

# Both Scaled and Unscaled are quite similar! Both are statistically significant.

Touch_GoalDiff_scaled_Analysis_plot 
```

*Both show statistical significance, Matches in where teams touch more, both overall frequency and compared to their individual profile, are associated with higher goal differentials.*

# *5. Type of Touch*

Looking at TYPE of Touch now, not only frequency.

*A weak but positive correlation was found between match-evel deviations from a team's season-average reciprocity ratio and goal differential. Teams perform slightly better in matches where they exhibit higher than usual reciprocity.*

# *6. Social Network Strength*

We explored whether the way touches are distributed across players within a team reflects its internal structure — and whether this structure relates to performance.

### Cleaning and Validating Player Interaction Data

We began by cleaning the `ToucherNumber`, `ToucheeNumber`, and `PlayersInvolved` fields to correct typos and inconsistencies. This preprocessing ensures that the subsequent player-level analyses are based on verified, interpretable entries. For example, values like "10. 12" were converted to "10,12".

## Player-Level Involvement: Team Touch Hierarchies

### Histograms per Team

To visualize player-level involvement, we plotted how often each athlete initiated (toucher) or received (touchee) a touch. Teams vary widely in how evenly touches are distributed across players.

```{r histogramforsocialnet, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toucher_histo
Touchee_histo
```

### Ridgeplots by Team Ordered by Gini

To quantify touch distribution within each team, we calculated a Gini coefficient per team. A higher Gini suggests that few players dominate the team's touch activity. The ridgeplots below highlight these disparities.

```{r histogramforsocialnet2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Toucher_plot_gini_ordered
Touchee_plot_gini_ordered
```

A high Gini indicates that touches are concentrated among a a few players; a low Gini suggests a more even distribution. 

### Combined Role Scatterplot (Toucher vs. Touchee)

We explored whether certain players consistently acted as both initiators and receivers of touch events. At the league level, there's a moderate positive relationship — players who initiate more also tend to receive more. Within teams, these patterns vary.

```{r rolescatter, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Toucher_v_Touchee_plot_global
Toucher_v_Touchee_plot_team
team_correlations_touchervtouchee
```


---

### Role Ratio and Centralization: Team-Level Patterns

We calculated a role ratio for each player: touches initiated / touches received. A ratio near 1 suggests balanced involvement. Some teams had wider spreads than others, indicating specialized player roles.

Role Ratio = tuoches initiated / touches received

A ratio near 1 suggests balanced participation.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
combined_ratios_plot
```

---

### Global Player Involvement: Across All Roles

We also considered a broader definition of touch involvement using the `PlayersInvolved` field. This includes all players present in the interaction, not just the toucher or touchee. Patterns echoed those seen in the prior plots, with a few players per team often dominating touch events. Therefore, this also includes group events. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
player_involved_histo
player_involved_ridgeplot
```

---

## Relative Contribution: Within-Team Normalization

To highlight intra-team roles, we normalized each player's involvement relative to their team average. A player well above the red line (mean) suggests high centrality within the touch network.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
player_counts_mean_plot
```

To better understand team hierarchies, we normalized each player’s touch count relative to their own team’s average. Players well above the team mean (indicated by a red line in the plot) appeared as hubs in their team’s social network. This revealed that some teams had clear focal players, while others were more egalitarian.

---

## Gini vs. Final Rank: Do Balanced Teams Win?

Finally, we tested whether teams with more evenly distributed player involvement (lower Gini) performed better across the season. Results suggest a moderate negative correlation between Gini coefficient and final rank — teams with more egalitarian touch networks tended to finish higher.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gini_rank_plot
spearman_corr_gini  # Spearman's rho
```


# *7. Time-Elapsed Touch Frequency*

Examines how Run-of-play touch frequency evolves throughout a match.
In this section, we examine how prosocial touch behavior evolves throughout the duration of a match. Specifically, we analyze the frequency of touches as a function of **match time**, using data from all eligible prosocial touch events across the season.

### Data Preparation
We filtered out negative, coaching, or administrative events (`TA`, `CO`, `NEG`) and excluded non-play situations like goals, substitutions, and cards (`GF`, `GA`, `SUB`). Time stamps for each touch were converted to total seconds and normalized to create a **percent-of-match-completion** variable.

Therfore, looks at Run-of-play (CoreData) touches.

```{r Histogram_TouchesTime, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
Histogram_TouchesTime
```

While this raw histogram by clock minutes gives a general impression, it does not normalize for variable match lengths.

### Final Figure: Smoothed Touch Distribution Across Time
```{r histogram_smoothline, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
histogram_smoothline
```

This normalized histogram shows how touches distribute across matches regardless of game length. 

The final visualization bins touches by **1% intervals** of match progress and overlays a **LOESS-smoothed trendline**. We observe:

- A sharp rise in touch behavior early in the match
- A relatively stable mid-game baseline
- A late-match uptick, possibly linked to urgency or team-level coordination needs

This pattern may reflect the evolution of interpersonal dynamics and game tempo. Future analyses may compare this with goal distribution, player fatigue markers, or team-specific variations.

## Touches before first goal.

Hypothesis: Teams that score the first goal of a match exhibit a higher touch count (up to that point) than their average in matches where they did not score first.

```{r firstgoalgraph, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

baselinetouch_plot

wilctestbase

```

Result: No significant difference; elevated pre-goal touch is not universally predictive.

## Touch by match outcome.

Compared number of touches before the average first-goal time (~30% match completion) for teams that won vs. lost.

```{r firstgoalgraph2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

combined_plot 

```

Result: Not significant overall, but became significant at adjusted thresholds (~40%), suggesting touch rate may rise slightly before or near goal events, especially in wins.

## Early Touch vs Outcome

Is there a statistically significant difference in early touches between winning and losing teams, if we define 'early' as up to X% of match time?

Basically asking when in the game does touch start to matter?

```{r firstgoalgraph4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

pval_plot

earlymatch_sum_wilc

```

Significant at 32%, which is within a few percentage points of the average first goal at 30%. 

*This aligns with a reverse association: once a team begins to gain the upper hand (possession, control, confidence), they touch more — even before the goal, but closer to it in time.*

## Post-goal Behavior

If a team scores the first goal, does their subsequent touch behavior differ depending on whether they go on to win or lose the match?

Have winning teams started to touch more than losing teams at this point?

```{r firstgoalgraph5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

boxplot_postfirstgoal

postgoal_wilc

touches_winloss_firstgoal_plot

```

Result: No statistically significant difference, but visual analysis shows touch rate maintenance or increase is more common in wins.

## Touch counts by rater and match

We first examine the total touch counts coded by each rater per match to check for discrepancies.
